## 📝 Reflection Questions

# 1. What would you improve if you had more time?

If I had more time, I would enhance the UI with better accessibility, add more detailed product information, and implement lazy loading for images to improve performance. I could also add features like sorting and pagination for better usability.

# 2. Describe a time you learned a new technology from scratch. What was it? How did you approach learning it? What challenges did you face?

This is my first project using Vue 3. I approached it by reading the official documentation, building small components step by step, and experimenting with state management and props. The main challenge was understanding `v-model` with custom components and 2 way binding, but I solved it through trial and error and looking at examples online.
Other than that, I found Vue.js somewhat similar to React.js, which I have mainly worked with.

# 3. If this had 10,000 products, what performance issues might arise? How would you handle them?

Rendering 10,000 products at once would cause loading and rendering issues. To handle this, I would implement pagination(backend fix mainly) or infinite scrolling to load products in chunks. Additionally, I would consider virtual scrolling or lazy loading images to reduce the initial render time.

# Thank you and i hope we can proceed with the interview process as im very interest in this positon. please get back to me if you got any questions.
